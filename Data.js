          info: "Vacation time is a great thing – and often the biggest bummer. No matter where you live or who you work for, nobody has unlimited PTO before retirement (even if your company policy say you do, y’all know what I mean…); most of us have to make trade-offs to see the world with what days we have – without losing any at year’s end or going over into unpaid territory.So if you – like most Americans – only have two weeks of vacation and you’re choosing to spend all of it in London, I admire your choice. London is a great city with a ton to offer – you can experience so much here you won’t need to feel like you need another vacation after spending two weeks in London.!",
